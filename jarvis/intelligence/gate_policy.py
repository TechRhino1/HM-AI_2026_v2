JARVIS AI 4.0 — Adaptive Quality-Gate Policy.

Per the user's directive, gate strictness is decided automatically by the AI:
- CRITICAL gates (market session, drawdown, margin, event-regime) are ALWAYS hard
  (they protect capital and are never softened).
- NON-critical gates (order-flow, AI score, premium/discount, spread, win-prob, EV)
  can be *softened* — converted into a confidence penalty instead of a hard block —
  but ONLY when we have evidence the strategy is currently profitable in this regime
  (recent win-rate above threshold) and only a small number are failing.

If there is no performance evidence yet, the policy defaults to BLOCK (identical to
today's behaviour), so it can never increase risk on an untuned system.
